\section{Programmable Storage}
\label{sec:progly}

When application requirements are not met by an underlying storage system the
most common approach is to design workarounds that roughly fall into one
of three categories:

{\bf Extra services.} ``Bolt-on'' services are intended to improve performance
or enable a feature, but come at the expense of additional hardware, software
sub-systems, and dependencies that must be managed, as well as trusted.
For instance, such classes of limitations inspired many extensions to Hadoop
~\cite{bu:vldb2010-haloop, ekanayake:hpdc2010-twister,
ekanayake:escience2008-eglmapreduce, mihailescu:hotstorage2012-mixapart}.

{\bf Application changes.} Change the underlying application with the addition of
 more data management intelligence or via the integration of domain-specific middleware
 represents another popular option for adapting to storage system deficiencies. 
 When application changes depend on non-standard semantics exposed by the storage
system (e.g. relaxed POSIX file I/O or MPI-IO hints) resulting the coupling 
can be fragile.
For example, both \cite{buck:hpc2011-scihadoop, gkantsidis:nsdi2013-rhea} do
an excellent jobs of partitioning data in Hadoop applications, but may not
withstand the test of time for future workloads, since the partitioning is
specific to scientific data.

{\bf Storage modifications.} When these two approaches fail to meet an
application's needs, developers may turn their attention to any number of
heavy-weight solutions ranging from changing the storage system itself, up to
and including designing entirely new systems. This approach can require
significant cost, domain knowledge, and extreme care when building or
modifying critical software that can take years of code-hardening to trust.
For example, HDFS fails to meet many needs 
of metadata-intensive workloads~\cite{shvachko:login2012-hdfs-scalability}.
Systems builder achieve performance improvement by modifying the underlying
architecture or API~\cite{balmin:sigmod2012-clydesdale}.

Rather than relying on storage systems to evolve or applications to
change, the novel technique of ``programmable storage"
manifests a hybrid approach which embraces interface instability without placing
an unmanageable burden on developers.

\subsection{The Programmable Storage Approach}

%\textcolor{red}{HELP! We can't decide if this section should be called ``The
%Programmable Storage Approach" or ``The Malacology Approach" -- I argue that
%Malacology is the prototype but Noah thinks Malacology Approach makes more
%sense.}

A programmable storage system helps future programmers co-design applications
and storage systems by exposing existing internal services so that 
they can be composed to form application specific
services~\cite{sevilla:eurosys17}.
Figure~\ref{fig:malacology} shows the architecture of Malacology, a prototype programmable storage system
implemented in Ceph, which exposes a variety of low-level internal services
such as custom object interfaces, cluster metadata management, and
load-balancing. While Ceph natively exposes file, block, and object
abstractions, Malacology demonstrated the construction of two real-world
services (ZLog~\cite{watkins:ucsc-soe-16-12} and Mantle~\cite{sevilla:sc15-mantle}) using only a combination of existing interfaces present in Ceph.

\end{figure}

ZLog is a high-performance distributed shared
log that implements the CORFU protocol~\cite{balakrishnan:nsdi12}.
This protocol achieves high-throughput using a soft-state network-attached
counter, and stripes log content over a cluster of flash devices each with a
protocol-specific storage interface. While CORFU is a stand-alone system,
Malacology is able to instantiate the same abstraction and approximate 
the same unique optimizations.

Malacology reproduces the CORFU network-attached counter service using a
capability-based mechanism found in the Ceph distributed file system for
managing cached metadata. The service models the counter state as temporary
exclusive access to file metadata.  The storage device interface in CORFU is
constructed using application-specific object interfaces in Ceph. These
software-based interfaces are constructed as a composition of low-level I/O
interfaces (e.g. an LSM-tree and a bytestream) that operate in an atomic
context allowing the interface to maintain consistency across native
interfaces.

The demonstration of interface synthesis in Malacology suggests a new form of
application development that significantly reduces the programming surface
area. While this ability to construct software-defined interfaces is powerful,
next we will show how access to low-level interfaces can be a double-edged
sword, which provides power at the cost of maintenance complexity.
